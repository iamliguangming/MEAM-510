# MEAM-510

This is the lab code for MEAM-510.

The team projects will begin soon. src/main.c is where the code should be at. The solutions to previous lab questions are in the "past code" folder. For reference, the header files are in the inc folder, including the teensy_general.h and t_usb.h (which is used for serial communication)

msys-1.0.dll is for Winavr. Winavr will run into compiler error without msys-1.0.dll replaced. The directory of msys-1.0.dll in Windows is C:Winavr/bin.

To compile the .hex file on MacOS, do not update to Mac OS Catalina. The AVRcrosspack and Teensy loader are both in 32bits while MacOS no longer supports 32bits programs after 10.15.

Have fun coding!
